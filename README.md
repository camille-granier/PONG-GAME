# PONG-GAME
Pong arcade game using Javascript, HTML And CSS.

This project has been realised with the help of [this beautiful tutorial from Hershal b](https://hershalb.com/how-to-make-pong-with-javascript/).

I customised it with a few different functions and styling.

You can play the game on my [Codepen](https://codepen.io/Dacelo/full/XWaMKMx)
 in which I imported the code.
 
Simply press the Space key to Start the game.
The left and right paddles are respectively by W and S, and left and up and down arrow.

Each game last until one of the player reaches a score of 5. 
After the score of 5 is reached the game restart with each player's score at 0.

I added my own audio mp3 files created with LMMS.
